<!-- # Case Study - Blue Bottle: Remix and Improve -->

## Learning Goals

- Understand how the Blue Bottle sprint team looked for solutions already existing in industries
- Understand how the Blue Bottle sprint team divided up sketching responsibilities
- Understand how every member (designer or not) of the sprint team was able to sketch their ideas

## Chocolate-inspired

Helping new customers choose a coffee bean online was particularly challenging because the process is reliant on non-visual senses. During their **Lightning Demos** (a technique that we will learn about later on today), they shared ideas from other industries such as clothes and wine, ultimately hoping to find new ways to describe aroma, flavor, and texture. One participant shared their appreciation of the packaging used by Tcho, a chocolate manufacturer based in Berkeley, CA.

> Printed on the wrapper of every Tcho bar is a simple flavor wheel with just six words: Bright, Fruity, Floral, Earthy, Nutty, and Chocolatey. “When Blue Bottle looked at that wheel, they got inspired, and when we sketched, someone repurposed the idea as a simple flavor vocabulary for describing Blue Bottle’s coffee beans.

One of the sketching subteams adopted the vocabulary as descriptions of their beans, which tested well with customers.

As you can see, non-coffee industries can offer the best solutions to similar challenges.

## Divide or Swarm?

With a list of ideas generated during lightning demos, as well as a defined target customer (new customer) and a defined target event (choosing beans), the team still had to decide how to move into sketching.

The full experience of choosing beans on their online site encompassed three separate pages:

1. The home page
2. The list of coffees
3. The shopping cart

Given this complexity, they decided to allow each person to work on whichever page they were interested in:

## Paper: The Great Equalizer

Some of the greatest ideas began on napkins. Most people are able to draw boxes and write words on a piece of paper, and anybody can sketch a solution.

### Some Blue Bottle Sketches

One sketch that focused on the home page simulated a conversation with a barista:

> The big idea behind “The Mind Reader” was to organize the online store the same way a barista might talk with a customer. As you can see in the three frames, this solution leads with a welcome, then asks how the customer prepares coffee at home, before offering recommendations and a brewing guide. - Excerpt from _Sprint_

Another solution centered around a basic search for coffee-brewing techniques:

Your biggest takeaway should be that none of these sketches are beautiful. Yes they're clean and legible, but this stage of Design Thinking is focused on designing a solution, not image or illustrations. As a result, a good sketch conveys a concept, not a technique or skill.

## Summary

- The Blue Bottle team found vocabulary used by another company to describe their chocolate products was effective for describing Blue Bottle's coffee blends.
- They split up tackling the home page, coffee listing page, and shopping cart page so that some effort was applied every part of the bean-selection experience.
- The goal of sketching is to convey a concept, not a drawing technique or skill.
- Anyone can sketch a solution using boxes, words, and other basic symbols.
