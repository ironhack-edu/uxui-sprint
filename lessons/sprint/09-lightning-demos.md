## Learning Goals

- Get familiar with the concept of Lightning Demos
- Understand what makes a good "How Might We" (HMW) statement

## Searching for Inspiration

> We all want a flash of divine inspiration that changes the world—and impresses our teammates. We want to create something completely new. But amazing ideas don’t happen like that... If you look at any great innovation, it's actually built on remixing old ideas...
> -- John Zeratsky, GV Design Partner

Lightning Demos consist on reviewing great solutions from other companies (in your industry as well as in other industries) and searching for ideas that you can use to inform your solutions.

The idea behind this is that you can collect and synthesize existing ideas and use these solutions as components, that can then be remixed and redesigned into something original that can help you solve your company's problems.

It can be helpful to look at non-competitive products that solve a similar kind of problem in a different market.

> This exercise is about finding raw materials, not about copying your competitors. We’ve found limited benefit in looking at products from the same industry. Time and time again, the ideas that spark the best solutions come from similar problems in different environments.

### Make a list

The best way to go about your research is to ask everyone on your team to come up with a list of products or services to review for inspiring solutions.

You can start by looking at what the competition is doing, but keep in mind that you are looking for **innovative** solutions that can set you apart from the rest of the industry and solve the problems your users (or potential users) are having with the current solutions in the market. So it is important to look outside the industry for things that are working elsewhere and can be applied or redesigned to work for your product.

Everything you review should contain something good you can learn from. It’s not helpful to review solutions that are not that great!

Once your team has come up with a list of solutions to look at, write it on the whiteboard.

## DEMOS: Presenting ideas with potential

Once you have the list up, your team will take turns giving three-minute tours of their favorite solutions.

Connect your laptop or phone to the overhead projector so everyone can see easily. One at a time, the person who suggested each product gives a tour—showing the whole team what’s so cool about it.

:::warning
It’s a good idea to keep a timer going: Each tour should be around three minutes long.

### Capture big ideas as you go

> Your three-minute Lightning Demos will go by quickly, and you don’t want to rely on short-term memory to keep track of all the good ideas. Remember the “Always be capturing” mantra and take notes on the whiteboard as you go.

- All Lightning Demos should answer the question **“What’s the big idea here that might be useful?”**

- A team member should make a quick drawing of that inspiring component, write a simple headline above it, and note the source underneath.

These notes are just quick visual reminders of what was presented, they don’t have to be fancy or detailed. For now, don’t waste time or energy making decisions or debating on which ideas are good or bad. Just capture anything that might be useful.

**Blue Bottle Coffee Lightning Demos**

As we discussed, during Blue Bottle's Lightning Demos they used the inspiration from the packaging used by Tcho chocolates and repurposed the idea to describe their coffee beans.

By the end of this exercise, you will have plenty of interesting elements. Later on, when you start sketching, you will use the whiteboard as a reference to pick and choose which of these elements you want to explore. most won’t turn into anything, but one or two may inspire a great solution.

You should have a whiteboard filled with 10-20 ideas. This amount is enough to make sure you’ve captured all the team member’s best inspiration, but also small enough that you won’t be overwhelmed when you start sketching.
