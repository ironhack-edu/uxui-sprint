- Use the Heat Map exercise to vote for strong ideas/solutions

## Expected Deliverables

- Heat Map with clusters of dots to mark the standout ideas

## 1. Art Museum

During this step, your team should tape-up the solution sketches on the wall (like an art exhibit) so that everyone in the team can take a good look at each concept.

**Things to remember:**

- Space the sketches out in one long row, just like the paintings in a museum. This spacing allows the team to spread out and take the time to examine each sketch without crowding.

- The sketches should also be placed in a roughly chronological order, following the storyboard.

## 2. Heat Map

Before the team begins looking, everyone will be given a bunch of small dot stickers (20-30). Then each person will follow these steps:

1.¬†Don‚Äôt talk.
2.¬†Look at a solution sketch.
3.¬†Put dot stickers besides the parts you like (if any).
4.¬†Put two or three dots on the most exciting ideas.
5.¬†If you have a concern or question, write it on a sticky note and place it below the sketch.
6.¬†Move on to the next sketch, and repeat.

> There are no limits or rules for these dots. If people want to put dots on their own sketch, they should. If people run out of dots, give them more.

:::warning
:white_check_mark: Remember that at this point, your team should not be discussing the ideas with each other.
:::

Once everyone is done voting, take a moment to look at the ideas where the clusters have formed, and the questions and concerns that other team members might have posted.

:::info
üï¥Ô∏è This is the first time in this course that you will put your ideas in front of other people and get feedback on them. Remember that as a UX designer, it is important to check your ego at the door and be open to feedback.
:::

One of the best things that can happen to you as a designer is to have others tell you when your ideas are not good early on - so that you can iterate and invest your time on ideas that are worth pursuing.

Remember that the goal is not to have your idea win, but to come up with the best possible solution for your user - as a team.

## 3. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Take pictures of your Heat Map so that you can add them to your team's Google Slides deck
