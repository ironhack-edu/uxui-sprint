<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: HMW's (How Might We) -->

## Learning Goals

- Be able to generate HMWs based on survey and interview data insights
- Learn to write effective HMWs - remember to keep them broad enough so they can generate a number of possible answers

## Agenda

- Read survey data and interview transcripts provided by the client to discover insights
- Use painpoints that you have found to create HMWs for Bloom Box
- Create a new slide in your Google Doc to list out your team's HMWs

## Expected Deliverables

- Organized board of HMW statements
- Decision on a target customer + target event

:::danger
Remember to take pictures of your deliverables (especially if they are on a whiteboard or post-its) so that you can include in your team's slide deck and reference them later on.

## 1. Gather materials

Every person on the team needs

- His or her own pad of sticky notes (plain yellow, three by five inches)
- Thick black sharpie or dry-erase marker
- Voting dots (round stickers)

> Using thick markers on a small surface forces everyone to write succinct, easy-to-read headlines

## 2. Taking Notes

1. Put the letters “HMW” in the top left corner of your sticky note.

2. Individually, read through the surveys + interview transcripts. Look for insights (user frustrations and needs)

  3. When you read/hear something interesting, convert it into a question (quietly).

  4. Write the question on your sticky note.

  5. Peel off the note and set it aside.

## 3. Organize your team's "How Might We" Statements

Once your team is done generating HMW statements, post them on a wall where everyone can see them. Make sure the spot you choose has enough space to fit all the post-its and reorganize them.

1. Start by posting them without any organization.

2. Now its time to physically group them by similarities.

Cluster the HMW's into categories. If two HMW's are almost exactly the same, you can place them one on top of the other, so that you

1. Can see which topics came up often
2. Don't have repeats when you vote

:::warning
⚠️ Remember: This process could go on forever if you let it, but the organization doesn’t have to be perfect. After **ten minutes**, the notes will be sorted enough to move on to prioritization.
:::

## 4. Prioritize HMW statements with Dot Voting

Everyone in the team should read each statement and vote on the HMW statements that they feel should be prioritized.

### Dot Voting:

1. Give two dot stickers to each person.
2. Give four dot stickers to the Decider because their opinion counts a little more.
3. Ask everyone to review the goal and sprint questions.
4. Ask everyone to vote in silence for the most useful How Might We questions.

:::warning
Remember: It’s okay to vote for your own note, or to vote twice for the same note.
:::

At the end of the voting, you’ll have clusters of dots on a few HMW statements, and the whole wall will be prioritized.

When the voting is over, take the How Might We statement with multiple votes, remove them from the wall, and find a place to stick them on your map (which you created earlier).

**Figure out where the HMWs fit along your map**

- What event does each HMW relate to?

## 5. Find a target customer + target event

The Decider needs to choose **one target customer** (if you had multiple target customers in your map) and **one target event** to focus on for the rest of the sprint.

:::warning
Whatever the decider chooses will become the focus of the rest of the sprint. It’s easiest if the Decider just makes the decision without a lot of discussion and process. After all, you’ve been discussing and processing all day.
:::

Once you’ve selected a target, take a look back at your sprint questions. You usually can’t answer all those questions in one sprint, but one or more should line up with the target.

## 6. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Add images of your HMW wall
- Add images of the dot-voting
- Add images of the map with HMWs
- **Digitize** - Type them out for clarity
- Type out the selected target customer and event you will be focusing on for the rest of the sprint
