## Introduction: User Experience IRL (In Real Life)

### User Experience Design

User Experience Design (UXD) is the process of enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the customer and the product.

Since UX design is concerned with all facets of the overall experience delivered to users, the UX scope includes elements of user research, psychology, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, web development, and other disciplines; making sure that they all work in unison to create a great **end-to-end experience**.

Don Norman coined the term **UX** while working at Apple in the 90's.

He realized that the experience of using personal computers was weak, so they set up a "User Experience architects" team at Apple to enhance this.

- When you first discover it
- When you see it in a store
- When you buy it and can't fit the big box into the car
- When you first open the box at home and are scared you won't be able to put it together

> "All of that goes into the User Experience. It's everything that touches upon your experience with the product... That's what we meant when we devised the term "user experience" ... Today that term has been horribly misused"
> [name= Don Norman]

People tend to think that the User Experience is about a digital device - that website or that app. But UX is the way you experience the product, the service, the entire system, within the context of your life.

Before jumping into the nitty gritty of UX Design, it is important to understand two things that impact the work of a UX designer:

1. Design Thinking, a modern strategy for driving innovation
2. How digital products are built today

## Creative Confidence, a foundation for Design Thinking

In the late 1980s, David Kelley had a conversation with the famed psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura had developed a practical framework for helping people overcome their fears, suggesting that any person could accomplish this by engaging in **Guided Mastery**, a series of successful experiences that eventually lead to a feeling of comfort. In hearing this, Kelley considered its application to people that feared creative exercises.

In education, this is known as **scaffolding**, a series of conceptual and applied exercises that gradually lead to mastery of a topic. Starting with the understanding that every person can be creative, he believed that non-creatives could build **Creative Confidence** by being introduced to it in small stages.

## Design Thinking, a modern strategy for driving innovation

This idea that anyone can think creatively through small steps eventually led to what is now known as the five-stage Design Thinking process. This process is a common strategy used by companies to activate creativity and solve big and small problems.

:::info
**Review exercise:** In the prework, you were introduced to a five-stage Design Thinking process developed by David Kelley at the Stanford d.School.

**Do you remember what those steps were, and what should be done at each step of the process?**

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How would you explain the five-stage process to a stakeholder (CEO, client, or small business owner)?
2. Which of the following do you think benefits the most from engaging in Design Thinking?
   a. small-business owner
   b. lawyer
   c. teacher
   d. designer
   e. developer

## Design Thinking, a case study: How to share your home with a stranger

Let's look at an example of how design thinking played a role in making Airbnb one of the world's most disruptive companies.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_82590239afd86a9927770e981cd579d4.png)

### The Challenge

Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk learned that a popular design conference in San Francisco fills hotels around the city with attendees every year, driving supply down and prices up. One year, while struggling to meet their own rent, they decided to advertise their home as an "airbed and breakfast" and were able secure reservations for three air mattresses at $80 each.

![](https://www.louisecampbell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/airbnb.png)

**Brian, Joe, and Nathan wanted their guests' experiences to be memorable.**

### Empathize

Anticipating what a stranger might experience during a stay in their home, they focused on three experiences:

1. Getting from the airport to their home
2. Learning about the SOMA neighborhood
3. Sleeping in a stranger's home

### Define

They narrowed down experience into goals:

1. How might we help them navigate to our home?
2. How might we teach them about the SOMA neighborhood?
3. How might we create a playful experience for a designer?

### Ideate

And started considering solutions:

1. What might an airport guide look like?
2. What might a neighborhood guide look like?
3. What might a playful T-shirt look like?

:::info
**Discussion questions:**

1. How could you rapidly prototype these ideas?
2. How could you test these ideas?
3. What is the value of Design Thinking when creating a company or product?
4. What other challenges do you think the founders of Airbnb might have addressed using Design Thinking?

### Value Proposition and Design Thinking

> A value proposition is a statement which clearly identifies clear, measurable and demonstrable **benefits** consumers get when buying a particular product or service. It should convince consumers that this product or service is better than others on the market. This proposition can lead to a **competitive advantage** when consumers pick that particular product or service over other competitors because they receive greater value.

In combination with traditional business tools such as market analysis and pricing strategy, Design Thinking can lead to an elevated value proposition by revealing an emotional element.

## Design doesn't happen in a vacuum

So how do great products come about, and what is the designer's role in building one? - A word about the world of products.

![](http://r1.ien.com/files/base/indm/ien/image/2016/02/16x9/640w/63477797_thumbnail.56cdc03468f38.jpg)

The world of digital products centers around a product team working on a unified product vision and strategy. The product vision and strategy are derived from the company's value proposition and KPIs - usually communicated by a member of the C-suite or business strategist.

![](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/05/images/product-team-synergy.jpg)

As a UX Designer, you're a member of the product team. Product teams minimally include developers, but can also include:

- A product manager
- Project manager
- Designers
- Researchers

Although it is important for everyone to be aware of business and user goals, it is your responsibility as the designer to create a solution that addresses both.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_69a1d9daa30277f796bfaa9c654d75a9.png =300x)

Thus, UX Designers should be business and development-minded, while their approaches should be user-centric. Attaining this balance can be practically and morally challenging as technology companies and their product teams navigate opportunities to serve and influence users.

## The GV Design Sprint

During the prework, we learned what GV Design Sprints are. This week, you'll get to experience Design Thinking in action by taking a product through the entire GV Design Sprint.

### A Review of GV Design Sprints

In 2012, a team that included Jake Knapp, Branden Kowitz, John Zeratsky, and Michael Margolis began running sprints with GV members. Through their collective experiences, they saw companies brainstorm strategies and commit significant resources to building huge products, only to find themselves stuck with a solution that no one wanted. They imagined a better, leaner system for answering key questions before any financial or human capital had to be committed.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_86a63731c2441acdf2783e76633e0806.jpg)

Using the structure of a five-day sprint, they combined proven practices from design, business, and product development, and had early success. Early trials produced answers to key product and business questions for participating companies and, in many cases, saved them millions of dollars in development and operational cost.

The GV sprint team has released ample resources for others to run their own sprints, the most comprehensive being _Sprint_ written by Jake Knapp with contributions from his collaborators.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_13ce5dcdf0dd0aa04f189701ef0d6b6c.png =200x)

## What is the GV Design Sprint?

As Jake Knapp puts it in _Sprint_, the essence of the sprint is as follows:

> The sprint gives our startups a superpower: They can fast-forward into the future to see their finished product and customer reaction before making any expensive commitments. When a risky idea succeeds in a sprint, the payoff is fantastic. But it's the failures that, while painful, provide the greatest return on investment. Identifying critical flaws after just five days of work is the height of efficiency. It's learning the hard way, without the "hard way." -Jake Knapp, _Sprint_

Ultimately the GV Design Sprint is intended to accomplish three things:

- Answer big questions
- Save time and money
- Jumpstart innovation

## Key Components

You've already read about stages in your prework, but let's review the key stages:

### Challenge

Start with a big problem that you're facing as a company. No problem is too big.

### Team (7 or fewer)

Participants should include a key stakeholder that already holds or is given decision-making authority and a mix of specialists.

### Learn

At the end of the sprint, reflect on both the journey and the outcomes. Convert your learnings into action items.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_02dfe878d61b2c9068212a38da0071a3.png)

### Monday

**Make a map and choose a target** - document the user's current experience and allow key stakeholder at the company who is present for the sprint to pick a direction for the week.

### Tuesday

**Sketch competing solution** - use an analog writing tool to rapidly ideate.

### Wednesday

**Decide on the best** - use silent community voting to determine a solution direction.

### Thursday

**Build a realistic prototype** - use a rapid prototyping tool to create a simulation of the desired experience.

### Friday

**Test with customer targets** - test the prototypes with pre-scheduled customers.

**Discussion question:** How could this process be used by a large company? What challenges might you face in conducting a GV Design Sprint with a large company?
:::

## What the GV sprint is not

- **Not a conventional UX design process** - Although it is called the "Design Sprint", think of "Design" in the context of "Design Thinking" and remember that non-design professionals engage in this too. Developers, business operators, CEOs, and other non-designers should be included in the GV Design Sprint.

- **Not a typical product sprint** - The GV Design Sprint is intended to push a company through a moment of friction, not as a substitute for agile sprints, which will be discussed later. Most companies, particularly large ones, are not organized to conduct GV sprints in their regular workflow, and attempting to do so would likely be too disruptive.

- **Not a substitute for research** - During execution, most GV Design Sprints are preceded by a round of data collection. Even if you can bring subject matter experts (SME) into the room, they are never a substitute for raw data.

## Summary

**Design Thinking** is a step-wise process that can be used by anyone to solve a problem or drive innovation.

**Digital products** are built by a product team whose makeup varies by organization and are solutions to business _and_ user needs.

**GV Design Sprint** is a specific Design Thinking structure that combines the Design Thinking conceptual framework with 5-day schedule and tools.
