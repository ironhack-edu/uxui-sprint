<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Divide and Conquer -->

## Agenda

- Decide how your team will divide rolls and work
- Split up the storyboard amongst the Makers

## 1. Define Team Roles

In order to put your prototype together within the limited timeframe, it's important to get organized before you start.

Your team should divide up tasks more or less in the following way:

• Makers (2 or more)
• Stitcher (1)
• Writer (1)
• Asset Collector (1 or more)
• Interviewer (1)

:::info
:exclamation: Depending on the size of the team, some teams members will have to take on more than one role. These should be team members who are not **Makers**.
:::

-- **Makers** create the individual components (screens, pages, pieces, and so on) of your prototype.

:::warning
You’ll want at least two Makers, as this is the most labor-intensive part.
:::

By now you will have a story board that your team designed together, the maker's job is to turn this into a finalized, high-fidelity version.

-- The **Stitcher** is responsible for collecting components from the Makers and combining them in a seamless fashion.

The best Stitcher is detail-oriented. The stitcher's job is to ensure consistency across the prototype.

::: info
:bulb: A good practice is to give everyone some style guides to follow in the morning. That way, when it comes time to do the stitching the amount of work won't be overwhelming.
:::

-- The **Writer** needs to make sure that any text on the prototype sounds credible and goes along with the experience you are trying to achieve. It’s impossible to make a realistic prototype with unrealistic text.

:::info
:book: A dedicated Writer becomes extra important if you work in a scientific, technical, or other specialized industry.
:::

-- The **Asset Collector** is in charge of speeding-up the process. This person should be a quick thinker and a good Google researcher!

Your prototype will likely include photos, icons, or sample content that you don’t need to make from scratch. Your Asset Collectors will scour the web to find these elements. This speeds up the work of your Makers, who don’t have to pause and go collect every bit and piece they need.

-- **The Interviewer** will use the finished prototype to conduct Friday’s customer interviews.

On Thursday, he should write an interview script.

:::warning
Although in traditional GV Sprints it is recommended that the Interviewer doesn’t work on the prototype, we want all the students to participate in this experience. Whoever takes the role of the interviewer should take another role as well.

## 2. Divide up the Storyboard

Depending on how complex your concept is, you might want to have **Makers** working on different customer touchpoints. Look at your storyboard and decide how it should be split amongst the team.

> Let’s say your storyboard calls for a customer to see an ad, visit your website, and download your app. You can assign one Maker to create the ad, one to mock up the fake website, and a third to handle the app download screens.”

**_Don’t forget the opening scene!_**

Remember: This is the **realistic** moment that happens before the central experience begins. Make sure there is a **Maker** and a **Writer** taking care of this!

It could be clicking on an ad, reading an article, or browsing through social media. Whatever that may be, it should feel relevant, natural, and real in order to put the user in the proper mindset.

> It’s important to give your opening scene enough time to be credible and set the stage. Don’t spend half your day working on it, but do make it believable.
