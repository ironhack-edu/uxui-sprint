<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Gather Feedback and Look for Patterns -->

## Agenda

- Watch all interviews as a team
- Draw a grid on the whiteboard which you will use to organize your notes
- Reorganize notes to find patterns
- Discuss and review the test results

## Expected Deliverables

- List the positive, negative, and neutral findings
- List the important patterns and insights you got from the test results

:::danger
:bulb: Remember to take pictures of your deliverables (especially if they are on a whiteboard or post-its) so that you can include in your team's slide deck and reference them later on.

## Gathering Feedback

Your team will be watching the interviews together. At the end of the day, your team can make an informed decision about what to do next— since the results of the interviews (and the sprint) are still clear in everyone’s short-term memory.

### 1. Taking Interview Notes as a Group

1. Before the first interview begins, draw a grid on a large whiteboard in the sprint room. Create five columns—one for each customer you’ll be interviewing—and a few rows—one for each prototype, or section of the prototype, or sprint question you’re trying to answer.

2. Distribute **Sticky Notes** to everyone on the team.

3. When you hear or see something interesting, write it down on a sticky note.
   - You can write down quotes, observations, or your interpretation of what happened.

::: info
Use color coding for your notes (either different sticky note colors or different marker colors) to differentiate observations between

- negative
- positive
- neutral
  :::

4. At the end of each interview, collect the notes and stick them to the whiteboard.

5. Put them in the correct row and column, but don’t worry about any other organizing just yet.

### Remember:

- During the interviews, the room should be quiet
  - The interview itself is a time for careful listening and detailed note-taking, not boisterous reactions or problem-solving on the spot
- Be respectful of the customer being interviewed
- Keep in mind that if they struggle with your prototype, it’s your problem, not the customer’s
- take breaks at the end of each interview. Focusing and taking notes for five hours is tiring, so get some downtime in between

## Looking for Patterns

After all the notes are up on the board, it is time to arrange them and find insightful patterns.

1. Ask the entire team to gather near the whiteboard and read the sticky notes.
2. Take about five minutes to silently review the notes; give each person a notepad and pen to write down patterns he or she sees.
3. After five minutes looking for patterns individually, ask the team to share what they found and read the patterns aloud.
4. On another whiteboard, list every pattern and label each one as positive, negative, or neutral.
5. Once the patterns are listed, it’s time to discuss and make sense of the results.

:::warning
**PRO TIP:**

- **Look for patterns that show up with three or more customers**
- If only two customers reacted in the same way but it was an especially strong reaction, make note of that too

## 2. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Take pictures of this activity at the different stages and add them to your deck
- Digitize your notes by creating a table so that you can review these later
- Write down the insights that your team found with this exercise
