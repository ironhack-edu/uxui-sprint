## Sprint presentations

Every group is going to present how their sprint went in just **10 minutes**. It's absolutely necessary that you stick to the time limit, as it's proven that your audience or stakeholders can't keep their attention hight for more than that time.

Be wise and prepare a presentation that focuses on decisive moments and highlights your team's unique work. Sometimes explaining the context (**the why**) of some decision made, may appear like a loose of time, but generally would give your project more personality and make your team memorable.
