<!-- # How to Prototype -->

## Learning Goals

- Get introduced to GV Sprint prototyping best practices
- Learn what tools to use
- Learn how to divide the work amongst the team to maximize your time

## Four exercises to prototype

Every prototype is different, so **there‚Äôs no exact step-by-step process to follow**, but GV recommends that you follow these four exercises to get started on the right path:

1.¬†Pick the right tools
2.¬†Divide and conquer
3.¬†Stitch it together
4.¬†Do a trial run

## Picking the right tools

> We need to talk about your tools‚Äîthe objects and devices your team uses every day, the software and processes and methods they use to create high-quality experiences for your customers. Here‚Äôs the challenge: You probably can‚Äôt use them for your prototype.
> Sorry.

The problem with using your regular tools is that they are too "perfect", and therefore **too slow**.

For example, if you think that you are comfortable and proficient with _Sketch_, chances are that you will be tempted to make use of these skills to make things extra perfect, which will end up being very time-consuming.

::: info
GV recommends using Keynote over a design software because it is simple, efficient, and screens can be made to appear interactive or exported into a prototyping software like InVison.
:::

For the purpose of this course, you can either do Keynote or Sketch, as long as you can **stay away from pixel-pushing and use your time productively**.

### If you‚Äôre not sure how to build your prototype, start here:

‚Ä¢¬†**If it‚Äôs on a screen** (website, app, software, etc.)‚Äîuse _Keynote_, _PowerPoint_, or a website-building tool like _Squarespace_.

‚Ä¢¬†**If it‚Äôs on paper** (report, brochure, flyer, etc.)‚Äîuse _Keynote_, _PowerPoint_, or word processing software like _Microsoft Word_.

‚Ä¢¬†**If it‚Äôs a service** (customer support, client service, medical care, etc.)‚Äîwrite a script and use your sprint team as actors.

‚Ä¢¬†**If it‚Äôs a physical space** (store, office lobby, etc.)‚Äîmodify an existing space.

‚Ä¢¬†**If it‚Äôs an object** (physical product, machinery, etc.)‚Äîmodify an existing object, 3D print a prototype, or prototype the marketing using _Keynote_ or _PowerPoint_ and photos or renderings of the object.‚Äù

## Divide and Conquer

Time is of the essence, so you want to make sure you use it **efficiently**.

In order to put your prototype together, your team should divide up tasks more or less in the following roles:

‚Ä¢¬†Makers (2 or more)
‚Ä¢¬†Stitcher (1)
‚Ä¢¬†Writer (1)
‚Ä¢¬†Asset Collector (1 or more)
‚Ä¢¬†Interviewer (1)

### What does each role take care of?

-- **Makers** create the individual components (screens, pages, pieces, and so on) of your prototype.

:::warning
:pencil: You‚Äôll want at least two Makers, as this is the most labor-intensive part.  
:::

-- The **Stitcher** is responsible for collecting components from the Makers and combining them in a seamless fashion.

The best Stitcher is detail-oriented. The stitcher's job is to ensure consistency across the prototype. He or she will probably give everyone some style guides to follow in the morning, then start stitching after lunch as the Makers complete their components.

-- The **Writer** is one of the most important roles. It‚Äôs impossible to make a realistic prototype with unrealistic text.

:::info
A dedicated Writer becomes extra important if you work in a scientific, technical, or other specialized industry.
:::

-- The **Asset Collector** role is key to **rapid** prototyping.

Your prototype will likely include photos, icons, or sample content that you don‚Äôt need to make from scratch. Your Asset Collectors will scour the web to find these elements. This speeds up the work of your Makers, who don‚Äôt have to pause and go collect every bit and piece they need.

-- **The Interviewer** will use the finished prototype to conduct Friday‚Äôs customer interviews.

On Thursday, he should write an interview script.

:::warning
It‚Äôs best if the Interviewer doesn‚Äôt work on the prototype. This way, he won‚Äôt be emotionally invested in Friday‚Äôs test, and won‚Äôt betray any hurt feelings or glee to the customer.
:::

### Dividing up the Storyboard

> Let‚Äôs say your storyboard calls for a customer to see an ad, visit your website, and download your app. You can assign one Maker to create the ad, one to mock up the fake website, and a third to handle the app download screens.‚Äù

**_Don‚Äôt forget the opening scene_**!

This is the realistic moment that happens before the central experience begins.

:::info
**Example: Blue Bottle Coffee**

For Blue Bottle Coffee, the opening scene was an article in the New York Times, and they needed someone to write a plausible article.
:::

> It‚Äôs important to give your opening scene enough time to be credible and set the stage. Don‚Äôt spend half your day working on it, but do make it **believable**.‚Äù

## Stitch it together

Your Stitcher will make sure dates, times, names, and other fake contents are consistent throughout the prototype.

Small things like tweaking the fonts and colors so that the slides appear to be one seamless app, adding detail to the sign-up screen, adding a slide with a screenshot of the iPad‚Äôs on-screen keyboard, to make it look as though the user was really typing... will help your prototype feel professional and realistic.

:::warning
üîé Look for typos and fix any obvious errors. Small mistakes can remind customers that they are looking at a fake product.
:::

When you divide work, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of the whole. The Stitcher will be on the hook to keep everything tight. Throughout the day, the stitcher can help other team members and check on progress to see if the various parts of the prototype look coherent.

:::info
If at the end there is still a lot to do to wrap up the prototype, the stitcher shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to ask the rest of the team to help out if more work is needed.
:::

## Trial run

The trial run should be done at around **3 p.m.**, so that there's enough time to fix mistakes and patch any holes you find in the prototype.

Set an alarm, and at **3 p.m.** have everyone pause work and gather around, then ask the Stitcher to walk through the prototype, narrating as he/she goes.

Use this exercise to:

- double-check against the storyboard to make sure everything made it into the prototype
- revisit your sprint questions to make sure your prototype will help you get answers
- make sure the interviewer gets familiar with the prototype

Since the **Interviewer** will be talking to the audience on Friday, he/she needs to be familiar with the prototype and the sprint questions in order to get the most out of the interviews.

If the Decider isn‚Äôt a full-time participant in the sprint, now is a good time for a cameo appearance. **The Decider can make sure everything matches what he/she was expecting.**

By the end of Thursday, you should have a finished, working prototype.

## Summary

- Picking the Right Tools: Make sure you pick tools that will allow you to work quickly and efficiently
- Use Keynote or prototyping software like InVision to make your prototype interactive
- Divide the work between the team into
  - 2+ Makers
  - 1 Stitcher
  - 1 Writer
  - 1 Asset Collector
  - 1 Interviewer
- Make sure you build the **opening scene** into your prototype (how customers got to your product in the first place)
- Stitch it together: Once all the makers are done, make sure the prototype looks like one consistent product
- Look for typos and fix any obvious errors. Small mistakes can remind customers that they are looking at a fake product
- The trial run should be done at around 3 p.m., so that there‚Äôs enough time to fix mistakes and patch any holes you find in the prototype
