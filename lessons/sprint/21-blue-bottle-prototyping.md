<!-- # Case Study - Blue Bottle: Prototyping -->

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will

- Learn why the Blue Bottle team chose to use Keynote
- Understand some of key differences between the three prototypes

## Up for the challenge

Do you remember the challenge that the Blue Bottle team set out to solve?

> How could he translate the magic of his cafés to smartphones and laptops? - Excerpt from _Sprint_

In order to recreate the magical coffee-buying experience in the digital space, the team knew that the answer lay in the simple interactions, language, and visuals. Testers would only need to click through a sequence of screens.

Knowing this, they chose to use Keynote--the deck creation software--to create simple, interactive prototypes. Keynote offered the right balance of speed and fidelity that allowed the team to create three simulated web-experiences in one day.

Keynote is popular tool in the industry for hyper-rapid prototyping of websites and apps. It's particularly effective for testing visual designs, concepts, and high-level user flows.

## The Façades

You might recall James wanting to prototype three approaches to online-shopping. Thus, the team split up into smaller teams, each of which included a designer from Dynamo (the participating design company).

Take a look at screenshots of the three prototypes. You'll notice that all three are high-fidelity, and you can imagine that some of the links are clickable. Also recall that each prototype was given a fake company name to help differentiate between the products during testing.

**Discussion Question:**

1. What differences between the prototypes do you notice?
2. How far into the shopping experience do you think they prototyped?

## Summary

- The Blue Bottle team picked Keynote as their prototyping tool because it offered the right balance between speed and fidelity.
- Each of the three prototypes is intended to simulate a distinct shopping experience through language, visuals, and basic interactions.
