<!-- # Interpreting Data and How Might We Statements -->

## Learning Goals

- Get familiar with interview transcripts
- Understand what makes a good "How Might We" (HMW) statement
- Know how to group HMW statements, prioritize HMW statements, and pick a target

## Gathering Data

A major step in understanding typically includes interviews with a subject matter expert (SME)--a person familiar with the industry, product, or customer. Think of this person like an expert witness in a litagation trial. There are a variety of advantages of speaking with a subject matter expert depending on the type of expert. An expert might be a founder, CEO, or product manager--someone close to the specific product. It might be an academic, business strategist, or marketer--someone familiar with the industry or customer. It even might be a technical expert--a developer, security expert, or systems architect.

While the GV Design Sprint incorporates an interview with a subject matter expert, the structure of this week does not allow us to schedule an expert for each group to interview. When we revisit user research in a later week, we'll cover the ins and outs of finding and interviewing SMEs.

## Turning raw data into useful data: An introduction to "How Might We" Statements

Recall from the Blue Bottle Coffee sprint that Jake Knapp conducted an interview round that resulted in the "Coffee-Buyer's Funnel" diagram. Similarly, we'll be using transcripts from previously conducted customer and SME interviews and survey results to build empathy with Bloom Box.

Taking the insights from the Coffee-Buyer's Funnel and combining them with the experience from the participating employees (the SMEs in this case), the sprint team focused on turning insights into "How Might We" Statements.

### What is a "How Might We" Statement?

As you interview and gather data on your users and the domain, it's easy to get bogged down in the problems and feel hopeless. That's why it is helpful to reframe problems as opportunities. This is where "How Might We" statements come in.

"How Might We" (HMW) statements are short statements that start with the phrase "How might we..." and end with an opportunity. HMW statements were developed at Proctor & Gamble in the 1970s and are promoted by design agencies and professionals including IDEO as a way to quickly turn problems into opportunities.

#### How to generate a HMW statement

1. As you read through transcript notes or listen to an SME, look for insights about user frustrations or needs.

> I am seven-years-old and I hate doing homework because it takes me forever to finish."

2. Create a HMW statement to answer that insight.

> How might we create a way for this student to do his or her homework more efficiently?

One way to know if you have created an effective HMW statement is to see if it can be answered in a multitude of ways. If it can’t, broaden it. Your HMW statement should generate a number of possible answers and will become a launchpad for your brainstorm.

_User Insight_:
I am a college student and I hate folding laundry because I can’t seem to fold it the right way.

*User Insight*:
I am the mother of five-year-old twins who hate vegetables of all kinds. I am worried about their nutritional needs.

*User Insight*:
I am a farmer who has a hard time getting up early even though I know I have to to take care of the animals. I keep sleeping through my alarm.

## Organizing "How Might We" Statements

Once the team feels that all possible HMW statements have been generated, its time to post them in a single location, like a wall, so that everyone can see all of them.

1. Start by posting them without any organization.

2. Now its time to physically group them by similarities.

This process could go on forever if you let it, but the organization doesn’t have to be perfect. After ten minutes, the notes will be sorted enough to move on to prioritization.

## Prioritizing statements

Now that the data is organized, it's time for everyone to read each statement and vote on the HMW statements that they feel should be prioritized.

**Dot Voting: A quick tool for democratic prioritization**

1. Give two large dot stickers to each person.
2. Give four large dot stickers to the Decider because her opinion counts a little more.
3. Ask everyone to review the goal and sprint questions.
4. Ask everyone to vote in silence for the most useful How Might We questions.
5. It’s okay to vote for your own note -- or to vote twice for the same note.

At the end of the voting, you’ll have clusters of dots on a few HMW statements, and the whole wall will be prioritized.

When the voting is over, take the How Might We statement with multiple votes, remove them from the wall, and find a place to stick them on your map.

The decider can also use big dots (representing 2 little dots) as done in the Blue Bottle sprint.

# Finding a target

At this point, the Decider needs to review the prioritization and make a couple decisions.

The Decider needs to choose **one target customer** and **one target event** on the map. Whatever she chooses will become the focus of the rest of the sprint. It’s easiest if the Decider just makes the decision without a lot of discussion and process. After all, you’ve been discussing and processing all day.

Once you’ve selected a target, take a look back at your sprint questions. You usually can’t answer all those questions in one sprint, but one or more should line up with the target.

## Summary

- Subject matter experts (SME) can be experts on different things: domain, customer, or the product.
- HMW statements turn problems into opportunities and help participants move toward a solution.
- Good HMW statements have multiple answers.
- HMW statements should grouped according to similarities.
- Finding a direction should start with silent voting, but end with a decision made by a key stakeholder (aka the Decider)
