<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Grid & Storyboard -->

## Agenda

- Assign an "artist"
- Set up the grid
- Decide on and draw the opening scene
- Fill the rest of the storyboard

## Expected deliverables

- 1 storyboard per team

## 1. Assign an "artist"

Choose one artist to draw the scenes. Your artist does not need to be artistic, but must be able to draw simple lines and write legibly.

## 2. Set up the grid

Depending on the shape your whiteboard or your paper, you can draw a 3x5, 5x3 grid, or any other layout. We recommend about fifteen frames on one whiteboard with each frame approximately the size of a standard 8.5x11 copy paper.

## 3. Choose an opening scene

Think of how customers normally encounter your product or service. Keep your opening scene simple: web search, magazine article, store shelf, etc. You can use one or two frames depending on the scenario.

## 4. Fill in the storyboard

Move existing sketches to the storyboard when you can. Draw when you can’t, but don’t write together. Include just enough detail to help the team prototype on Thursday. When in doubt, take risks. The finished story should be five to fifteen steps.
