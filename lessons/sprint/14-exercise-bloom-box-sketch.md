<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Sketch! -->

<!-- ![]() -->

## Agenda

- Review crazy 8 outputs and choose a solution to sketch
- Agree on drawing tools
- Sketch your solution

## Expected deliverable

- One three-panel storyboard sketch per team member

## Sketching is the hardest easy thing you'll do this week

The difference between a "good" sketcher and "not-so-good" sketcher is probably not what you think. It's not about the straightest lines, the prettiest illustrations, or the neatest handwriting. The key difference has to do with clarity. Good sketchers know when and where to apply detail such that the utility of each screen is obvious. Sometimes a header for a section of content is sufficient, sometimes you'll need to write out a paragraph of content.

For this exercise, you're going to take one solution from your crazy 8 page and build out a basic storyboard. Your focus should be on a logical interaction between your target user and your solution and applying detail where its necessary to communicate the utility of your solution. If this is your first time, it probably will take you more time that you'd expect. Don't worry, the more you do this, the faster you'll get.

A few more tips:

## 1. Make it self-explanatory

Tomorrow, you’ll post your sketch on the wall for everyone to see. It needs to explain itself. Think of this sketch as the first test for your idea. If no one can understand it in sketch form, it’s not likely to do any better when it’s polished.

## 2. No-name

Don’t put your name on your sketch, and agree as a team on what writing tools you'll use. When you evaluate everyone’s sketch, this anonymity will make it much easier to critique and choose the best ideas.

## 3. Be word-conscious

Strong writing is especially necessary for software and marketing, where words often make up most of the screen. But choosing the right words is critical in every medium. So pay extra close attention to the writing in your sketch.

## 5. Give it a catchy, yet descriptive title (like "The Mind-Reader")

Since your name won’t be on your sketch, give it a title. Later, these titles will help you keep track of the different solutions as you’re reviewing and choosing. They’re also a way to draw attention to the big idea in your solution sketch.

:::danger
:bulb: This time will be primarily spent with everyone sketching on their own. This is intentional so as to ensure that ideas are divergent and so no one sees each others' sketches before tomorrow's silent voting round. There is a tendency to want to compare sketches at this stage. Resist this urge as it tends to be counter-productive and stifles creativity.

## Sketching a three-panel storyboard

1. As a team, agree on drawing tools
2. Start with a blank sheet of paper
3. Put 3 sticky notes on it
4. Each sticky note is one frame in the storyboard (imagine filling in comic book scenes)

:::warning
Ask yourself if each frame is self-explanatory and if the three frames together communicate your idea without any verbal explanation or long, written paragraphs.

## Summary

- Good sketchers focus on clarity
- Don't put your name, agree on drawing tools as a team, and come up with a catchy title
- A storyboard sells a solution, not a collection of screens
