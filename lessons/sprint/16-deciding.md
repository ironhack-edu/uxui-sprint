## Learning Goals

- Get introduced to the GV decision-making process
- Learn key techniques that will be used to pick the solution that will be prototyped

## Picking a solution

The goal for _Wednesday_ is to decide which solution to prototype. By now, your team should have a stack of solutions. That’s great! But it's time to do the hardest task of all: edit down and narrow your focus. We can’t prototype and test all the ideas, so we need to make a choice.

Logically, the next step would be to have a conversation with your team about the possible solutions and agree on one, but that's easier said than done! This is the part of meetings and group projects that tends to get tedious. The conversation goes on and on, people wander off on tangents, and in the end no one is happy with the decision. Trying to get everyone on the same page and agreeing on one solution is time consuming and draining.

> Left to our own devices, we humans tend to debate this way:”

> “These discussions are frustrating because humans have limited short-term memory and limited energy for decision-making. When we jump from option to option, it’s difficult to hold important details in our heads. On the other hand, when we debate one idea for too long, we get worn out...”

Lucky for us, the GV team has used their extensive experience in this area to device a process that makes arriving at solutions fair, quick, and almost pain-free.

## The science behind effective decision-making

In GV Sprints, decision-making is structured to do one thing at a time. Your team will evaluate solutions all at once, critique all at once, and then make a decision all at once.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_cff79638306a9069e54f7dd79430e286.png)

Optimizing decision-making to be as efficient as possible is a 5-step process:

1. **Art museum:** Put the solution sketches on the wall with masking tape.
2. **Heat map:** Look at all the solutions in silence and use dot stickers to mark interesting parts.
3. **Speed critique:** Quickly discuss the highlights of each solution and use sticky notes to capture big ideas.
4. **Straw poll:** Each person chooses one solution, and votes for it with a dot sticker.
5. **Supervote:** The Decider makes the final decision, with—you guessed it—more stickers.

> The dot stickers let us form and express our opinions without lengthy debate, and the sticky notes allow us to record big ideas without relying on our short-term memory.

Let's look at each of the steps in more detail:

### Art Museum

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_6e50b7eb813b3e9c35a4a54af1b77035.png)

Up to this point everyone in the team worked individually and nobody has seen the solution sketches yet.

During this step, the solution sketches will be taped on the wall (like an art exhibit) so that everyone in the team can take a good look at each one silently and form their own opinions.

:::info
:bulb: Space them out in one long row, just like the paintings in a museum. This spacing allows the team to spread out and take their time examining each sketch without crowding.
:::

The sketches should also be placed in a roughly chronological order, following the storyboard.

### Heat Map

This next step is crucial in efficient decision-making because it doesn't allow for people to defend their solutions.

> Explaining ideas has all kinds of downsides. If someone makes a compelling case for his or her idea or is a bit more charismatic, your opinion will be skewed. If you associate the idea with its creator (“Jamie always has great ideas”), your opinion will be skewed. Even just by knowing what the idea is about, your opinion will be skewed.

In the real world, especially in the digital product world, **ideas need to stand on their own**. If a digital product has to be explained, it will probably won't make for a great user experience. And if they are confusing to the experts in the team, they will probably be confusing to the customers.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_d1bb23564ec4db5d77d5452f2bd5b698.png)

So instead of a discussion, team members will use round stickers to vote on the solutions that stand out to them the most.

:::success
:heavy_check_mark: Before the team begins looking, everyone will be given a bunch of small dot stickers (20-30). Then each person will follow these steps:

1. Don’t talk.
2. Look at a solution sketch.
3. Put dot stickers besides the parts you like (if any).
4. Put two or three dots on the most exciting ideas.
5. If you have a concern or question, write it on a sticky note and place it below the sketch.
6. Move on to the next sketch, and repeat.

> There are no limits or rules for these dots. If people want to put dots on their own sketch, they should. If people run out of dots, give them more.

The result is a **"heat map"**.

😜 Fun fact: the term was borrowed from heat maps used in the weather industry.

As you can see, this will quickly show you what solutions generated the most interest and attention, which in turn are probably the strongest solutions, and then ones you should prototype and test!

:::info
As we discussed in the Blue Bottle Coffee example:

After voting ended, the team discussed any feature by which a dot-cluster formed. Any standout ideas were noted on a new sticky note and posted on the wall above the sketch.
:::

### Speed Critique

Heat mapping is a great way to spot strong ideas and conserve decision-making energy, but this technique has obvious limitations:

1. There's no way to know exactly **why** people liked an idea.
2. If you don’t understand the sketcher’s intent, the heat map can’t explain it to you.

Speed critiques are a way to give the team an opportunity to discuss out loud while avoiding our natural impulse to get caught up in debate. The conversation will follow a structure—and a time limit (3 minutes per idea).

:::info

For this activity, your team needs to designate a **Scribe** who will be in charge of writing down stand-out ideas on sticky notes.

These notes:

**1.** Give everyone a common vocabulary to describe solutions.
**2.** Help everyone on the team to feel heard, which speeds up the discussion.
**3.** Organize the team’s observations, making it easier to place your votes in the next step.
:::

#### Here’s how the speed critique works:

Within a timeframe of 3 minutes:

- The group will gather around a solution sketch
- The facilitator will narrate the sketch and call out standout ideas that have a cluster of stickers by them
- The scribe will take notes and stick them above each sketch, giving the idea a simple title
- The team will review concerns and questions
- **At the end** (and not before) the creator will have a chance to explain any missed ideas and answer questions
  - If the inventor pitched his or her idea from the beginning, the rest of the team would have a harder time being critical or negative

Then, it's time to move on to the next sketch.

### Straw Poll

> A straw poll is a nonbinding vote used to gauge a group’s opinion (like holding up a piece of straw to see which way the wind is blowing).”

This simple exercise is a quick way for the whole team to express their opinions, and a way to give your Decider - _in this case, your instructor_ - some advice on which solution to pick.

- Everyone gets one vote (big dot sticker)
- The team will review the long-term goal and sprint questions
- Everyone takes ten minutes to think about their favorite idea (it could be a whole sketch or just one idea in a sketch)
- When time is up, everyone places their votes on the sketches
- Each person quickly explains his/her vote

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_59e32d00b272646d281255c5acbccb0d.png =500x)

> With the speed critique loaded into short-term memory, those sophisticated brains can focus on just one task. No managing a conversation, no articulating your opinions, no trying to remember what that sketch was all about. Just apply your expertise and make an informed decision.

### Supervote

The supervote is the ultimate decision. The **Decider** (or deciders) in your team will get 3 special votes (with their initials in them) and whatever they vote for is what your team will prototype and test.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_812d2c747983cfd4299b5ea651065275.png)

At this point, your team should rearrange the sketches so that ideas with the supervotes are all together.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_bb738c934f5f428e77f02ea35767eaaa.png)

The sketches with the **supervotes** on them are the winners!

:::danger

> It’s important to note that this decision-making process isn’t perfect. Sometimes, Deciders screw up. Sometimes, good ideas don’t get selected (at least, not in the first sprint). But the “sticky decision”—if not perfect—is pretty good and very speedy. That speed helps with the sprint’s larger goal: getting real-world data from Friday’s test. Ultimately, it will be that data that leads to the best decisions of all.
> :::

## Rumble

What happens when two or three ideas are all winners? which one do you prototype? Sometimes, the winning ideas complement each other and can be merged into one prototype. But what if the ideas are conflicting and can't coexist?

**It's time for a head-to-head battle!**

When you have two solid, conflicting ideas, you don't need to force them together or choose between them at all. Instead, you can prototype both. This way, you can put both ideas in front of users on Friday's testing and get real user feedback before you commit to either!

#### Rumble or All-in-One?

If you have more than one winning solution, involve the whole team in a short discussion about whether to do a Rumble or combine the winners into a single prototype. As you can expect by now, the **Decider** will make the final call.

## Summary

- In GV Sprints, decision-making is structured to do one thing at a time. Your team will evaluate solutions all at once, critique all at once, and then make a decision all at once.
- The decision-making process is made up of 5 steps
  - Art Museum, Heat Map, Speed Critique, Straw Poll, Supervote
- Team members will use round stickers to vote on the solutions that stand out the most.
- Speed critiques will allow discussion in a structured environment, with a 3-minute time limit.
- Voting will help guide the process, but the **decider** has the final say on which solution will be prototyped.
- If two solutions are winners you can either merge them into one (if they are compatible), or develop and test two different prototypes.
