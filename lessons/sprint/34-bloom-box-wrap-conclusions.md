<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Wrap Up Conclusions -->

## Agenda

- Discuss and wrap up the sprint

## Going Full Circle

Now that you have reached the end of the sprint, it is time to go back to the beginning :satisfied:

## 1. Look back at the sprint questions

- Use these questions to decide which patterns are most important
- Determine what the next steps should be based on your findings

:::warning
:exclamation: You probably won’t answer every question, but you will know what worked and what didn't, which means you've made progress and will know what the next steps are.
:::

## 2. Discuss and Decide

The team can have a short discussion, and then the **Decider** decides how to follow up.

### Things to keep in mind

> The best part about a sprint is that you can’t lose.

Sprint results don’t follow a neat template, so don't be disappointed if you did not get the results you were expecting. Any which way, you win.

As long as you test your prototype with customers, you'll have the chance to learn, in just five days, whether you’re on the right track with your ideas.

Even if your test fails, now you know what to look for and what to change for the next iteration!

:::success
:bulb: Every interview draws you and your team closer to the people you’re trying to help with your product or service.

## 3. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- A summary of the discussion and decisions your team took and the plan moving forward
