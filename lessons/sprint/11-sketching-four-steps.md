## Learning Goals

- Understand how to review insights from the research phase and begin generating new ideas
- Understand how to quickly sketch solutions focused on a user experience

## The Wind-Up

Solutions come in various shapes and sizes. Before diving into solutions, we'll take some time today to filter through the current customer experience, consider key takeaways from the lightning demos, and then generate starter ideas for solutions.

## 1. Review Notes

This first step is super-easy. The team walks around the room, look at the whiteboards, and take notes. These notes are a “greatest hits” from the past twenty-four hours of the sprint. They’re a way to refresh your memory before you commit to a solution.

## 2. Generate Ideas

This is an opportunity to start thinking about what solutions might look like. One way to do this is through a mind-map. If you’re not familiar with mind mapping already, you just write down everything in your head with no specific formatting. You can write words and connect them or not, you can draw pictures or not — you basically can't-do it wrong. The important thing is that everyone is getting every solution, old and new, out of their head and onto paper at very low fidelity.

## 3. Crazy 8

Everybody folds a blank sheet of paper in half three times, then unfolds it, so they get eight panels. Then you have 5 minutes total to draw eight sketches, one in each panel. Yes, you did the math correctly, that’s about 40 seconds per sketch, which is crazy… but it’s a great way to crank out variations of ideas quickly. And since these aren’t shared with the group, there’s no need to worry about making them pretty.

## 4. Sketch

Each sketch will be a three-panel storyboard drawn on sticky notes, showing what your customers see as they interact with your product or service. This storyboard format allows products and services to be more like movies than snapshots. Customers don’t just appear in one freeze frame and then disappear in the next. Instead, they move through your solution like actors in a scene. Your solution has to move right along with them.

## Summary

- Start an ideation session by reviewing what you learned about the business and the customer experience.
- Use semi-structured ideation exercises like mind-mapping and crazy 8's to generate new ideas.
- Sketching through storyboarding creates solutions instead of just screens. In this way, the focus remains on the customer's experience rather than the minute details of a screen.
