<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Prototyping -->

## Agenda

- Build prototypes

## Expected deliverables

- 1-3 prototypes per team, exported as HTML. (This will let you test even if the internet is unreliable)

## Build your prototype(s)

By this point, you should have chosen your prototyping tools and divided roles and responsibilities.

**It's time to actually start building prototypes.✏️**

:::info
⏰ Prototyping can be time-consuming, so try to **reuse assets and components** as often as possible. An efficient prototyping workflow is a critical skill to build for an interaction designer.

### Tips for prototyping with a presentation tool

If you're prototyping with a presentation tool (Keynote or Powerpoint), here are some tips that may save you some time:

1. Set the slide size so that the screen fills the screen completely in presentation mode
2. Use _master slides_ for basic screens. This will allow you to recycle screens and update them all at the same time
3. Create an asset library (logos, button styles, user avatars, etc.) that you can frequently used assets from.
4. One slide per screen state. This means a toggle in an on-state will be on one slide, while the same toggle in an off-state along with any other triggered changes will be on another slide
5. Add interactivity using click events
6. Remember that you're trying to simulate how pages in a website would load. If you prototype an animation, make sure it's critical to the experience
7. Self-test your prototype early and often
8. Focus on building screens that fit the storyboard and don't forget your opening scene!
9. Lean on the asset collector and writer to find images and generate content
10. Export your designs in HTML, so you can load it (offline) in a browser for the test. [Learn more about exporting presentations to HTML](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH26007?locale=en_US)
