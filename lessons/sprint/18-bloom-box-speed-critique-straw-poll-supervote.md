<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Speed Critique, Straw poll, & Supervote -->

## Agenda

- Go through Speed Critique of your team's sketches
- Do a Straw Poll to "vote" on everyone's favorite idea
- Decide which idea(s) will be prototyped tomorrow

## Expected Deliverables

- Speed Critiques with notes
- Straw Poll + Supervote results
- Final decision on what will be prototyped

:::danger
:bulb: Remember to take pictures of your deliverables (especially if they are on a whiteboard or post-its) so that you can include in your team's slide deck and reference them later on.

## 1. Speed Critique

In the speed critique, you and your team will discuss each solution sketch and make note of standout ideas.

For this activity, your team needs to designate a

- **Facilitator**: who will point out the dot clusters and narrate what is going on in the sketch

- **Scribe**: who will be in charge of writing down stand-out ideas on sticky notes

These notes:

**1.** Give everyone a common vocabulary to describe solutions.
**2.** Help everyone on the team to feel heard, which speeds up the discussion.
**3.** Organize the team’s observations, making it easier to place your votes in the next step.

#### Here’s how the speed critique works:

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_02b556679f998338f3b09bf0ca6aaa42.png)

**1.** Gather around a solution sketch.

**2.** ⏰ Set a timer for three (3) minutes.

**3.** The Facilitator narrates the sketch. (“Here it looks like a customer is clicking to play a video, and then clicking over to the details page...”)

**4.** The Facilitator calls out standout ideas that have clusters of stickers by them. (“Lots of dots by the animated video...”)

**5.** The team calls out standout ideas that the Facilitator missed.

**6.** The Scribe writes standout ideas on sticky notes and sticks them above the sketch. Give each idea a simple name, like “Animated Video” or “One-Step Signup.”

**7.** Review concerns and questions.

**8.** The creator of the sketch remains silent until the end. (“Creator, reveal your identity and tell us what we missed!”)

:::warning
:eyes: **Remember:**

- It is crucial to learn to hear and value feedback - there is no place for egos in user-centered design

- As the creator, it will be frustrating when others don't understand your idea or don't find them as amazing as you do! But sometimes we are too close to realize our ideas are weak or confusing

- It is important to take a step back and see how other people are understanding and interpreting your idea before you pitch it and defend it

- This keeps the process honest since **THE BEST IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT CAN STAND ON THEIR OWN**

:::

**9.** The creator explains any missed ideas that the team failed to spot and answers any questions.

**10.** Move to the next sketch and repeat.

#### Speed Critique Best Practices

- Try to keep each review to three minutes, but be a little flexible. If a sketch has a lot of good ideas, take a couple of extra minutes to capture them all.

- Remember the goal is to create a record of promising ideas. You don’t need to debate whether something should be included in the prototype; that will come later.

- Don't try to come up with new ideas on the spot. Just write down what stands out about each solution.

- Focus on the best ideas and keep a positive tone. Don't waste time tearing bad ideas apart, just move on quickly if there is nothing useful on a certain sketch.

You should end up with something like this:

## 2. Straw Poll

After the Speed Critiques everyone will have one last chance to express their opinion on which solution they thing should be prototyped.

Remember: The goal of this exercise is to give the whole team a chance to express their opinions, but the votes are not decisive. They will just work as a poll, to give your **Decider** - _in this case, your instructor_ - some feedback on which solution to pick.

### Here's how the Straw Poll works:

**1.** Give everyone one vote (represented by a big dot sticker— or a different color sticker from the ones used in the previous exercise).

**2.** Remind everyone of the long-term goal and sprint questions.

**3.** Remind everyone to err on the side of risky ideas with big potential.

**4.** ⏰ Set a timer for ten (10) minutes.

**5.** Each person privately writes down his or her choice. It could be a whole sketch or just one idea in a sketch.

**6.** When time is up, or when everyone is finished, place the votes on the sketches.

**7.** Each person briefly explains his or her vote (⏰ only spend about one minute per person).

:::warning
:eyes: Remember: Don't start a conversation, no articulating your opinions. Use the sketches, the notes, and your memory from the speed critiques to make an informed decision.

## 3. Supervote

The supervote is the ultimate decision. The **Decider** in your team - _your instructor_ - will get 3 special votes (with their initials on them) and whatever they vote for is what your team will prototype and test.

At this point, your team should rearrange the sketches so that ideas with the supervotes are all together.

The sketches with the **supervotes** on them are the winners!

## Ready to Rumble

At this point, you will know which ideas are the winners. If there is more than one strong idea, now is the time to decide how you will proceed.

If you have more than one winning solution, involve the whole team in a short discussion about whether to do a Rumble or combine the winners into a single prototype. As you can expect by now, the **Decider** will make the final call.

There are two options:

- **ALL-IN-ONE:** If you think you can combine your winning sketches into one product, don’t bother with a Rumble. Instead, put them together into your best shot at solving the problem.

- **RUMBLE:** If two winning ideas are conflicting, or can't logically coexist in one prototype, don't try to force them together. Create two separate prototypes instead.

This way, you can put both ideas in front of users on Friday's testing and get real user feedback on which idea is stronger before you commit to either!

## 4. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Take pictures of your Speed Critique, Straw Poll, and supervotes (with reorganized layout) so that you can add them to your team's Google Slides deck
- Add a short description of what happened, and how you came to deciding on which idea to prototype
