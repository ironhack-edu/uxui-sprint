<!-- # Blue Bottle Sprint Presentation & Overview -->

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will:

- Understand the structure and goals of this week
- Get familiar with Blue Bottle Coffee - the case study we will be using to guide this design sprint
- Know how to quickly research a company through an "About Us" page
- Understand the challenge that Blue Bottle Coffee wanted to address through a Design Sprint
- Understand how Blue Bottle Coffee created long-term goals, sprint questions, and maps

## Week 1: Intro, agenda, and goals

This week is all about diving into a design sprint. Design sprints can take on many forms and span various timelines, the GV Design Sprint model is just one of many ways you can go about a sprint. You've already been introduced to the key components of the GV Design Sprint, and you'll be engaging in a full 5-day sprint so you can **practice the five stages of Design Thinking** with a real-world example. You will also be introduced to some basic tools and tactics that designers use to research, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

Each day you'll be introduced to a new concept, strategy, tactic, and/or tool. As a class, we'll walk through an example, and you'll spend time in groups working on a real product. We believe the best way to learn is by doing, so we were very intentional about centering your experience on a product you can interact with.

Let's take a look at what you can expect this week:

### How to optimize your experience

At times this week may feel overwhelming, but continue to think critically about the exercises and your engagement in the content and activities. You'll find that what you get out of the experience will be dictated by what you put in. If that means asking more questions, ask. If that means looking for additional resources, go and find them!

Finally, consider journaling a key insight from the day to reflect on what you have learned so far.

## Blue Bottle Coffee: The Challenge

[Blue Bottle Coffee Website](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/)

Blue Bottle Coffee (founded in 2002) is an Oakland based roastery and retailer well recognized in the American coffee industry as an innovator in roasting techniques. GV invested in Blue Bottle Coffee as part of a $20 million round.

At the time, Blue Bottle's website looked like this:

Founder James Freeman knew he needed to create a better e-commerce experience for his company, but didn't know how.

> James had many plans for that money, but one of the most obvious was building a better online store for selling fresh coffee beans. But Blue Bottle wasn‚Äôt a tech company and James was no expert at online retail. **How could he translate the magic of his caf√©s to smartphones and laptops?**‚Äù
> -- Excerpt from _Sprint_

James sat down with Branden Kowitz and John Zeratsky from GV to discuss this challenge, and all three agreed to organize a sprint. Throughout this week, we'll walk through the Blue Bottle Coffee case study. After discussing the case study, you engage in the stages of the Design Sprint with Bloom Box, a real client to whom you'll be introduced later. Right now, let's get to know Blue Bottle Coffee.

## Blue Bottle Coffee: The Company

Any new engagement with a company should start with gathering information about that company.

:::info
**Discussion Question:** What are some quick ways to get some information about a company?
:::

### "About Us" pages

An "About us" page is a great place to quickly gather information about a company and just about every company with a digital presence has an "about us" page.

When looking at "About us" pages, try to pull as much information about that company _and_ its people as you can.

Things to look for include:

- Company mission, vision, and values
- Value propositions
- Operational information
- Historical information
- Team member bios

:::info
**Class Exercise**:
Let's take a look at [Blue Bottle Coffee's "About us" pages](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/our-story).

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_41c3af791c5af34e17d059f958b5c2d3.png =500x)

Using boxes, arrows, and labels, let's draw a quick diagram of the "About us" pages on the whiteboard.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_ca117e08df3ce9d0b45095e6f6d05c80.png)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How does Blue Bottle Coffee organize its company information? What are some of the benefits or challenges of distributing information this way?
2. What does the title "Our Story" imply in regards to what you should expect to read on this page?
3. What key information can you gather from any of the "about us" pages?
4. Having read the Blue Bottle Coffee About Us page, how would you describe the company in no more than three sentences in your own words?

## Setting the stage

After gathering data about a company, it's important to gather data about their customers/users. Before the sprint, James interviewed coffee-drinkers:

> We needed to understand how people shopped for coffee on the web, so we planned a research study and talked with potential Blue Bottle customers. Based on the interviews, we developed the ‚Äúcoffee buyer‚Äôs funnel,‚Äù which kept our design decisions grounded in the real world.

:::info
**Discussion Question**:

Below is the visualization that resulted from the coffee-drinker interviews.

**Why might this information be a useful starting point for the Design Sprint?**

:::

### The Sprint Team

In addition to gathering data, it is also important to decide who will participate in the sprint. Remember that bringing together **seven or fewer participants** from various key areas of the company (marketing, design, development, sales, customer service) should be the goal. You want to look at the problem + opportunities from every angle.

- Blue Bottle Coffee employees
- Dynamo, a digital design agency that executed the designs
- **Decider** - James Freeman, founder and CEO of Blue Bottle Coffee

## Start at the End

Starting any sprint begins with imagining what success will look like even if you don't yet know how you're going to accomplish it. As a team, you need to set priorities before jumping into solutions.

### Setting long-term goals

To start their sprint, the team asked themselves the following:

_Why are we doing this project? Six months or a year later, what would we have improved about our business as a result of this project?_

> The Blue Bottle team targeted new customers purchasing coffee beans. James wanted to focus the sprint on this scenario because it was so difficult. If they could establish credibility and create a great experience for someone who had never heard of Blue Bottle, let alone visited their caf√©s or tasted their coffee, then every other situation should be easy by comparison.
> -- Excerpt from _Sprint_

With this, the team was ready to focus on one specific goal during the length of the sprint.

:::info
**Blue Bottle Coffee's long-term goal**

‚ÄúBring great coffee to new customers online.‚Äù
:::

### Turning Assumptions into Questions

When creating a long-term goal, it's good to think critically about the goal and break it down into questions that would need to be answered to reach it. To figure out what these questions are, ask yourself the following:

- What questions do we want to answer in this sprint?
- To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?
- Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused that?

:::warning
**Key to forming sprint questions**
Turn assumptions and potential obstacles into questions.
:::

:::info
**Blue Bottle Coffee's Assumption and Question**

_Assumption_
New customers have to trust our expertise.

_Question_
Will new customers trust our expertise?
:::

Depending on the number of assumptions you start with, you may end up with only 1 or 2 sprint questions. **Quality over quantity**.

## Visualizing the journey

Once you've defined your long-term goal and sprint questions, it's time to visualize what the current customer or user journey looks like.

### Make a Map

1.¬†**List the actors (on the left)**
The ‚Äúactors‚Äù are all the important characters in your story. Most often, they‚Äôre different kinds of customers. Sometimes, people other than customers‚Äîsay, your sales team or a government regulator‚Äîare important actors and should be listed as well.

2.¬†**Write the ending (on the right)**
It‚Äôs usually a lot easier to figure out the end than the middle of the story. Blue Bottle‚Äôs story ended with buying coffee.

3.¬†**Words and arrows in between**
The map should be functional, not a work of art. Words and arrows and the occasional box should be enough. No drawing expertise required.

4.¬†**Keep it simple**
Your map should have from five to around fifteen steps.

5.¬†**Ask for help**
As you draw, you should keep asking the team, ‚ÄúDoes this map look right?

**Discussion Question**:

Is there anything on this map that is surprising? Why would they include the "Web Search" step? Where does the journey begin for the customer?
:::

:::warning
**Key to mapping**

- This exercise is about understanding the current customer/user experience with regard to an objective. Thing broadly.
- This is not a final draft; as you go through the week, you might remember a key step in the journey that you need to add. If so, add it.

## Summary

- This week, the GV Design Sprint will be used to engage in Design Thinking and walk you through the process.
- Blue Bottle Coffee conducted a Design Sprint because they wanted to improve their online experience.
- Long-term goals keep the sprint grounded in a unified objective.
- Sprint questions are derived from assumptions the team is making about the long-term goal.
- Maps help the team think critically about a user's current experience with their product.
