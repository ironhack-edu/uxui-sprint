## Agenda

- Trial run with the whole team
- Finalize the prototype

## Expected deliverables

- Finalized prototype(s), exported in HTML

## The Trial Run

This is an opportunity to note down flaws in the prototype. Run the prototype in a browser.

**Some things to remember**:

- double-check against the storyboard to make sure everything made it into the prototype(s)
- revisit your long-term goal and sprint questions to make sure your prototype will help you get answers
- make sure the interviewer is familiar with the prototype(s)

:::danger
:warning: If you have multiple prototypes, keep an eye out for a potentially long testing session. You don't want the tester feeling fatigued by the time he/she gets to the last prototype; mental fatigue breeds frustration.

## Finalizing the Prototype

Implement any updates to the prototype as necessary. Remember that your goal is a realistic prototype. Realistic doesn't mean complex; realistic means that it feels like an authentic experience.
