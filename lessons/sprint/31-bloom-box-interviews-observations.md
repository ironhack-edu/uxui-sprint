## Interview

**Alright, this is it! Let's gather some data. Remember, focus on open-ended questions.**

1. **Friendly welcome.** Welcome the customer and put him or her at ease. Explain that you’re looking for candid feedback.
2. **Context questions.** Start with easy small talk, then transition to questions about the topic you’re trying to learn about.
3. **Introduce the prototype.** Remind the customer that some things might not work; and that you’re not testing him or her. Ask the customer to think aloud.
4. **Tasks and nudges.** Watch the customer figure out the prototype on his or her own. Start with a simple nudge. Ask follow-up questions to help the customer think aloud.
5. **Debrief.** Ask questions that prompt the customer to summarize. Then thank the customer, give him or her a gift card, and show the customer out.

## Observe Together

As you're watching the interview as a team, you want to document anything that stands out.

1. Establish norms
   - Respect the tester; they're helping you out even when they're only sharing frustrations.
   - Try to channel your thoughts through the sticky notes instead of verbally. You'll have an opportunity to share and discuss after the interview is complete.
2. Write quotes, observations, or interpretations on sticky-notes; one per sticky-note. - Use a red marker or a minus for a frustration - Use a green marker or a plus for positive comments - Use a black marker or a zero for a neutral comment
