<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Stitch it together + Testing Guides -->

## Agenda

- Decide how your team will divide rolls and work
- Split up the storyboard amongst the Makers
- Stitch pieces together
- Prepare testing guide

## Expected Deliverables

- Finished working prototype
- Testing Guide

:::danger
:bulb: Remember to take pictures of your deliverables (especially if they are on a whiteboard or post-its) so that you can include in your team's slide deck and reference them later on.
:::

By now, the **makers** in your team will be done with all the parts of the prototype, and it is time to put them together.

## 1. Merging the Prototype

The **Stitcher** is responsible for collecting components from the Makers and combining them in a seamless fashion.

It is important to be detail-oriented in order to ensure consistency across the prototype.

Here is a list of things that should be consistent across the prototype:

- fonts
- colors
- layout
- logo size and position
- position of universal objects such as navigation or status bars
- dates, times, names, and other fake content

:::warning
üîé Look for typos and fix any obvious errors. Small mistakes can remind customers that they are looking at a fake product.
:::

If time permits, this is the time to add some extra details to make the experience feel even more realistic.

:::danger
‚ùóÔ∏èREMEMBER: If at the end there is still a lot to do to wrap up the prototype, the stitcher shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to ask the rest of the team to help out if more work is needed.
:::

By the end of the day you should have a high-definition, realistic, working prototype, ready to be tested tomorrow.

## 2. Write a testing guide

A user test can vary according to the goals of the test and your experience as a researcher. The guide is a planning document to guide the eventual interviewer through the process and is important for upholding testing standards and establishing consistency across test events. Even the most experienced researchers write and use testing guides. Regardless of your preferred testing methods, it's always best to prepare for a test with a guide. We'll share some best practices for you to consider.

### General Structure of a testing guide

Not all of the following are necessary and may be instead detailed in a previously written Research Plan:

1. Business context
2. Goals/Objectives of test (testing is about validating hypotheses...what questions do you need answered?)
3. Target user (as specific as necessary)
4. Description of testing method and tactics (qualitative interview? eye-tracking? error tracking?)
5. List of materials/tools needed
6. Compensation for participation (if any)
7. Test questions

### The questions

Recall the user test conducted during last weeks GV Sprint? That serves as a great starting block for a flow of questions:

:::info
**Friendly welcome.** Welcome the user and put him or her at ease. Explain that you‚Äôre looking for candid feedback.
**Context questions.** Start with easy small talk, then transition to questions about the topic you‚Äôre trying to learn about.
**Introduce the prototype.** Remind the user that some things might not work, and that you‚Äôre not testing him or her. Ask the user to think aloud.
**Tasks and nudges.** Watch the user figure out the prototype on his or her own. Start with a simple nudge. Ask follow-up questions to help the user think aloud.
**Debrief.** Ask questions that prompt the user to summarize. Then thank the user, give him or her a gift card (if providing), and show the user out.
:::

You might be thinking, "Why do I need to write down my 'Friendly Welcome?' questions. If you're like the rest of us, you forget things. It's impossible to overemphasize the importance of setting the tone of the test. If you want candid, quality data during a qualitative test, make sure your user feels comfortable. And of course, avoid those leading questions. Have someone else on your team proofread for leading questions. Trust us, it's worth it.

## 3. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Images of all the screens/sections on your prototype with annotations
- A link to your prototype (if it was put together on a prototyping software like InVision)
