## Learning Goals

- Learn how to take interview notes as a team
- Understand the process of reviewing the results and determining what's next.

## Group Work

After you team has performed all the interviews, instead of waiting for the Interviewer to watch them and report back, you will be watching them together. This method is:

- Faster: because everyone is absorbing the results at once.
- Efficient: Your conclusions will be better as a group, since you have seven brains working together.
- Unbiased: You’ll avoid problems of credibility and trust, because each sprinter can see the results with his or her own eyes.

At the end of the day, your team can make an informed decision about what to do next— since the results of the interviews (and the sprint) are still clear in everyone’s short-term memory.

### Taking Interview Notes as a Group

1. Before the first interview begins, draw a grid on a large whiteboard in the sprint room. Create five columns—one for each customer you’ll be interviewing—and a few rows—one for each prototype, or section of the prototype, or sprint question you’re trying to answer.

2. Distribute **Sticky Notes** to everyone on the team.

> When you hear or see something interesting, write it down on a sticky note. You can write down quotes, observations, or your interpretation of what happened.”

Use color coding for your notes (either different sticky note colors or different marker colors) to differentiate observations between:

- Negative
- Positive
- Neutral

#### Best Practices:

- During the interviews, the room should be quiet.
  - The interview itself is a time for careful listening and detailed note-taking, not boisterous reactions or problem-solving on the spot.
- Be respectful of the customer being interviewed. Keep in mind that if they struggle with your prototype, it’s your problem, not the customer’s.

At the end of each interview, collect the notes and stick them to the whiteboard. Put them into the correct row and column, but don’t worry about any other organizing just yet.

:warning: Remember to take breaks at the end of each interview. Focusing and taking notes for five hours is tiring, so get some downtime in between.

### Looking for Patterns

At a first glance, a whiteboard full of sticky notes might seem random. But since everyone has watched the interviews together, turning observations into patterns will be a straightforward process.

Ask the entire team to gather near the whiteboard and read the sticky notes. Take about five minutes to silently review the notes; give each person a notepad and pen to write down patterns he or she sees.

**Look for patterns that show up with three or more customers.**

> If only two customers reacted in the same way but it was an especially strong reaction, make note of that, too.

After five minutes looking for patterns individually, ask the team to share what they found and read the patterns/insights aloud. On another whiteboard, list every pattern and label each one as positive, negative, or neutral. Once the patterns are listed, it’s time to make sense of the results.”

### Back to the future

> Now that you’ve run your test and identified patterns in the results, it’s time to look back at those sprint questions. These questions will help you decide which patterns are most important, and also point you toward next steps.

At the end of your own sprint, you’ll review your long-term goal and sprint questions from Monday. You probably won’t answer every question, but you will know what worked and what didn't, which means you've made progress and will know what the next steps are.

The team can have a short discussion, and then (you guessed it) the **Decider** decides how to follow up.

### A winner every time

> The best part about a sprint is that you can’t lose.

The results don’t follow a neat template. You can have efficient failures that are good news, flawed successes that need more work, and everything in between. But as long as you test your prototype with customers, you'll have the chance to learn, in just five days, whether you’re on the right track with your ideas.

### Made for people

Even if the results are not what your team expected, or if they indicate you need to do more testing; every interview draws you and your team closer to the people you’re trying to help with your product or service.

> If you continue running sprints, and if you’re true to your vision, the day will come when you’ll close that gap. You’ll be watching some Friday’s test, and you’ll see people understand your idea, believe it will improve their lives, and ask the Interviewer how to buy it.

This is what a great design team is all about - **working together to build something that matters to real people!**

## Summary

- Your team will be watching the interviews together
- Before the first interview begins, draw a grid on a whiteboard
  - 5 columns: 1 for each person you'll interview
  - rows: for each prototype, section of the prototype, or sprint question you are trying to answer
- The team will take notes of important insights and put them on the board, at the end you will organize these into patterns and review together
