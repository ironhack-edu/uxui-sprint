## Faking It

> “Thursday is about illusion. You’ve got an idea for a great solution. Instead of taking weeks, months, or, heck, even years building that solution, you’re going to fake it.”

Prototyping is like building a facade for a movie set. The audience will get the feeling that it is real, but behind the layer of visuals, there is nothing else. This allows your user to react as if they were **using the real thing**, without the time and financial investment.

For most products, the customer-facing side is the last thing that is done, and probably the one that takes the least time. (_For example: programming Amazon's search algorithm vs. laying out the products to display on a grid_). As long as the prototype shows some sort of search interaction, and those products on the grid, the customer will experience it as "real".

For user testing, you only need to worry about what the users see and experience during the specific flow you are trying to test. So instead of building the entire thing, you will "fake it" and **focus on the parts that the customer will interact with**.

It seems impossible to be able to prototype something in one day, but since you have decided on the key features and laid out a storyboard, you will know exactly what needs to be included to test for the specific results you are looking for.

:::warning
A case could be made that you could build a better prototype if you had more time. But this idea is missing two important points:

1. Prototyping is a tool in the learning process, spending more time than is needed will only slow you down.
2. The more time you spend developing an idea, the less open to criticism and more reluctant you will be to change it.

**The faster you can find out if your idea is good or bad, the better!**

## The Prototype Mindset

> “To prototype your solution, you’ll need a temporary change of philosophy: from perfect to just enough, from long-term quality to temporary simulation.”

GV calls his philosophy the “prototype mindset,” and it’s made up of four principles:

### 1. You can Prototype ANYTHING

The only thing you need to build a realistic prototype is to believe that it can be done! No matter how complex your idea is, if you have conviction that there is a way to "fake it", you will almost always find it.

From messaging bots, to waiting rooms, and even dancing and interactive robots, companies across the globe have used the GV Sprint method to successfully prototype ideas in just one day.

### 2. Prototypes are Disposable

It is easy to lose sight of the goal and want to make your prototype perfect. But a good rule-of-thumb is to "never prototype anything that you are not willing to throw away."

:::warning
Remember: This solution might not work. So don’t give in to the temptation of spending a few days or weeks getting your prototype ready.

### 3. Build Just Enough to Learn, but Not More

> The prototype is meant to answer questions, so keep it focused. You don’t need a fully functional product—you just need a real-looking facade to which customers can react.

Most people tend to be bad at estimating how long something is going to take. Overestimate and prioritize, to make sure you **don't run out of time**.

### 4. The Prototype Must Appear Real

> To get trustworthy results in your test on Friday, you can’t ask your customers to use their imaginations. You’ve got to show them something realistic. If you do, their reactions will be genuine.

Although in other design processes you will want to test low-fidelity, paper prototypes when you are developing the concept, because this is a 5-day sprint and you will only get one chance to test, you want to make sure that your prototype looks as real as possible.

#### How real is real enough?

> When you test your prototype on Friday, you’ll want your customers to react naturally and honestly.

The argument is that if you show users paper prototypes or wireframes, **the illusion will break**, and customers will switch into feedback mode - trying to be helpful and think up suggestions.

This kind of testing is appropriate in other scenarios, but in a GV Sprint, the customer's **reaction** is more important than the feedback. And to get a genuine reaction, you need to maintain the illusion that they are testing a real product (or as close to real as necessary).

## Summary

- Prototyping is about building a facade that gives the users the illusion of interacting with a real product
- The prototype should focus on the parts of the product that the customer will interact with during your test
- Spending more time that is needed to develop a working prototype will only slow down the learning process
- The more time you spend developing an idea, the less open to criticism and more reluctant to change you will be
- The Prototype Mentality is based on the philosophy that:
  - You can prototype anything
  - Prototypes are disposable
  - You should build just enough to learn, but no more
  - The prototype must appear real enough to get genuine reactions from the users testing them
