<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Divide or Swarm + Notes/Ideas -->

## Agenda

- Divide the target event or swarm the single whole event
- Review key ideas and annotate notes

## Divide or Swarm

1. As a team, look at your map and consider if the target event is necessary to divide
2. Discuss the major stages of the target event and list them on the whiteboard
3. If dividing, each member should vote silently which stage he/she would like to work on

## Notes

In preparation for sketching, it's good to take a moment to reflect on insights from the previous day.

1. Grab a notetaking medium
2. Copy down the long-term goal
3. Review the user map, HMW questions, and the notes from the Lightning Demos
4. For 20 minutes, write, circle, or annotate key ideas that strike you or might lead to a solution

:::warning
:bulb: Write down anything that looks useful. Don't worry about coming up with any new ideas, and don't worry about being neat. You can also further research examples shared during the Lightning Demos.

## Ideas

Now it's time to turn your thoughts into a mind-map

1. Jot down rough ideas on a sheet of paper with doodles, sample headlines, diagrams, or stick figures doing stuff
2. Draw a line or arrow between any ideas related to each other
3. Label illustrations that you might want to refer to later
4. Review and circle your favorite ideas
