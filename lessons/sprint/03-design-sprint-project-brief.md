## Bloom Box: The Company

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_eef0b9342c56c3384187d58edeaffb1c.png)

Bloom Box (founded in 2016) is a young company that is looking to disrupt the online flower-gifts market by offering a customizable, one-of-a-kind product that focuses on the message, rather than the medium. The company’s mission is to keep the customer at the center of the experience by creating flower-gifts as unique as the reason for gifting them.

With industry giants like 1-800 flowers, FTD, and Teleflora dominating online search results (and therefore online sales) customers find themselves in front of a website displaying hundreds of pre-designed arrangements arbitrarily clustered into categories like “Birthday, Get Well, Thank You, etc”. What makes a flower arrangement ideal for the “Thank You” category or the “Get Well” category is mostly a mystery, and browsing for the perfect arrangement becomes an overwhelming experience.

Instead of offering a huge variety of arrangements to choose from, Bloom Box has one product that comes in 3 different sizes. The box is then customized to display a personal message and customers can put in special requests for the types of flowers and color palette that will come in the arrangement.

By shifting the focus from amount of arrangements to choose from, to customization with flower choice and personal messages, Bloom Box is able to reduce inventory costs, stay lean, create a consistent product, and simplify the flower-buying experience.

## Bloom Box: The Challenge

Bloom Box currently sells exclusively online, and their marketing efforts are focused on creating a strong social media presence and digital advertising through Instagram and Facebook. Their innovative, eye-catching arrangements have allowed them to attract customers while browsing their social media feeds; which means most of their traffic comes from users on mobile devices.

But despite good results from their marketing and branding efforts to drive traffic to the site, the client is seeing a large drop-off rate once the users get to the product page and try to customize their Bloom Box.

The client would like to improve the online shopping experience in order to increase their conversion rate (ratio of people that visit the site vs. people who actually place an order). **They want the shopping experience to be as simple, fresh, and fun as their flower boxes are.**

## Bloom Box: Setting the Stage

**Customer Interviews**
In order to obtain user data, interviews and surveys were conducted over the last couple weeks in advance of this sprint.

Through 2 different surveys, the company asked both current users and potential users to answer key questions about the flower-buying process and their experience with the Bloom Box website.

They also interviewed potential users to uncover current pain points and behaviors around the flower-buying process.
