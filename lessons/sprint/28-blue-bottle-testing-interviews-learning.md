<!-- # Blue Bottle: Testing, Interviews, and Learning -->

## Learning Goals

- Understand how Blue Bottle staged the testing environment
- Understand how Blue Bottle conducted and observed interviews
- Understand how Blue Bottle turned their observations into learnings
- Understand how Blue Blue implemented their learnings

## The testing environment

Since their scenario focused entirely on a digital purchasing experience, the Blue Bottle team only needed to set up a digital testing environment with enough space for their interviewer and tester. In addition, they set up a separate observation room (out of sight of the tester) where the rest of the team could observe and listen through Google Hangouts.

## Interviews and Observations

With most of the day dedicated to running interviews, five testers were scheduled for 1-hr interviews.

### Interviews

Each interview followed this general structure:

1. The interviewer, John, introduces himself and explain the agenda to the tester.
2. John asks questions about him/herself and his/her coffee-buying habits.
3. John sets the context for the first prototype and encourages the tester to "think aloud."

   :bulb: **Think aloud** refers to the practice of sharing thoughts while completing a task.
   :::
4. John guides the tester through a series of tasks for the first prototype, predetermined during interview planning, and asks probing questions throughout.
5. John asks the tester to reflect on their experience and share any thoughts or questions.
6. John then guides the tester through two more rounds of task-completion and reflection for the other two prototypes.

   :exclamation: This style of testing is what the GV Sprint creators call a "Rumble", pitting ideas against each other with the hope of finding a clear winner.

### Observations

With the rest of the team sitting in another room, watching and listening via Google Hangouts and a conferencing phone, they set up their note-taking whiteboard:

**Discussion questions**: Looking at the whiteboard above,

1. What do the labels P1, P2, P3, and P4 represent?
2. What types of notes were taken and how are they distinguished?

Simultaneously, one volunteer for each interviewer was responsible for transcribing everything that was said by the tester (and when possible, the interviewer).

## Learning and picking a direction

After the interviews and a break for lunch, it was time to come together and review the notes. Everyone was given five minutes to look for and jot down patterns that they saw. Afterwards, an open discussion about the patterns was facilitated by Jake and the James, the decider, was asked to pick a direction forward.

> One idea was an efficient failure; the other two were flawed successes. Blue Bottle took the best elements from those two winners and merged them into a website that dramatically increased sales. - Excerpt from _Sprint_

Interestingly, the team found that a coffeeâ€™s origin mattered **much less** to customers than they initially assumed. Instead, James decided to sort coffee by how you make it.

## After the sprint

Continuing to work with Dynamo, the design agency, Blue Bottle developed a website centered around the idea that online customers start their shopping experience looking for brewing information.

**Discussion Question:** In the mid-fidelity wireframe above, can you find evidence of the designers applying the learning that brewing method was more important to customers than bean origin.

And here's what their site looked like a few weeks after the sprint:

Since 2013, their site has evolved as evidenced by the reemergence of bean-origin as a key component of the shopping experience.

:::info
**Discussion Question:**

1. What might you hypothesize are the reasons for this evolution?
2. Does this evolution suggest the learnings from the Blue Bottle sprint were invalid? Why or why not?

## Summary

- The testing room housed the tester and a designated interviewer. A separate observation room was set up for the rest of the team to observe and take notes.
- Observations were documented on a whiteboard so that the team could learn together.
- Time was dedicated to finding and discussing patterns and the sprint was concluded with the decider choosing to move forward with successful components of two of the prototypes.
- After the sprint, the team continued to work with the design agency, Dynamo, to iterate a solution that applied the insight that brewing method trumped bean-origin when it came to shopping for coffee online.
- Since 2013, the site has continued to evolve due to evolving customer behavior patterns.
