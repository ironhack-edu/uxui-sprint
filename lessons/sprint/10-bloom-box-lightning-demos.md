:bulb: Remember to take pictures of your deliverables (especially if they are on a whiteboard or post-its) so that you can include in your team's slide deck and reference them later on.

## 1. Inspirational Research

Collect and synthesize existing ideas from other companies and industries that can help you solve the problem.

:::warning
:eyes: Remember: It can be helpful to look at non-competitive products that solve a similar kind of problem in a different market.
:::

### Make a List

Ask everyone on your team to come up with a list of products or services to review. Think about innovative companies in any space, apps with features that you love that can help you solve the problem you are tackling, or do a Google Search to find new products/solutions you might have never heard of.

Just like in the case of Blue Bottle, your research doesn't have to be limited to digital products. Good design inspiration can come from lots of different sources! Be creative!

## 2. Lightning Demos

Once you have the list up, your team will take turns giving three-minute tours of their favorite solutions.

1. Connect your laptop or phone to the overhead projector so everyone can see easily.

2. One at a time, the person who suggested each product gives a tour—showing the whole team what’s so cool about it.

3. Set a timer to make sure you don't go over 3 minutes per presentation.

## 3. Capture big ideas as you go

1. Someone in the team should make sure to ask the presenter the question **“What’s the big idea here that might be useful?”**

2. Designate a team member to make quick drawings of the inspiring component being presented

3. Write a simple headline above it, and note the source underneath

:::success
By the end of this exercise, your team should have a whiteboard filled with 10-20 ideas.

## 4. Add these deliverables to your Google Slides Deck

- Add images of your Lightning Demos with a quick headline explaining the concept and the source
