<!-- # Making Storyboards -->

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will:

- Understand the purpose of storyboards
- Understand how to set up a storyboard grid
- Understand how to choose an opening scene
- Understand how to fill the storyboard

## What is a storyboard?

A storyboard is the _representation of use cases_ through a series of drawings or pictures, put together in a narrative sequence. Storyboarding is a practice adopted from the television and film industries, which use storyboards to plan out scenes. In the product world, storyboards serve as both internal and client-facing tools to align on the narrative that surrounds your product and the experience of its users.

Yesterday, you were created to one type of storyboard--the three-panel storyboard--which acted as a vehicle for iterating new solution ideas. While storyboards can take various forms, for today, we'll focus on whiteboarding a storyboard as a team. Team whiteboarding is a common exercise for design teams and you'll find it is a good skill to master.

## Setting up the grid

For today's storyboard, you'll be setting up a 3x5 grid on your whiteboard.

As you might expect, the storyboard will run left to right, top to bottom.

## Choosing an opening scene

You'll want to start your storyboard with some context. Where are your users coming from when they reach your product? If it's a new customer trying your mobile app, start with app store. If you're prototyping a bike, start in a garage or at the bike store.

> In real life, Slack was getting lots of great press. Many of their new customers discovered the service by reading an article about it. So [the decider] suggested we use a fake New York Times article for our opening scene. -Excerpt from _Sprint_

In the above example, the Slack sprint team was trying to figure out how to describe their product to new customers. Given that long-term goal, it made sense to choose a scenario that brought new customers to their app-page. Spend one or two tiles on the step(s) before the customer reaches your product.

For an early stage company that is trying to build a customer-based, here are some possibilities for targeting a new customer:

- Web search with your website nestled among the results
- Magazine with an advertisement for your service
- Store shelf with your product sitting beside its competitors
- App Store with your app in it
- News article that mentions your service, and possibly some competitors
- Facebook or Twitter feed with your product shared among the other posts

In these types of scenarios, there is an opportunity to present your product alongside competitors. If you think it valuable, you may even consider testing your product against the competition later on.

## Filling out the storyboard

Whoever is the designated drawer should start by filling in the opening scene(s). From this point, it's time to go step by step filling in the frames until you've completed a full user flow. Remember to think like you're writing out a comic and imagine the interactions, not just the static screens.

Any opportunity to fill in a frame with a sticky note from the sketching round should be taken as long as it fits the direction that your decider has chosen. Any frames that need to be drawn should be critical to the main objective. If the user has three possible paths, choose the path that you believe will be chosen 80% of the time.

:warning: This is not the time to ideate new solutions. Take conventional examples to fill in blanks when necessary and focus on the journey(ies) that encompass your solution(s).

When you reach the steps that show your solutions, it's likely that you'll need to flesh out the steps. If you're storyboarding for a digital product, your goal should be to represent every click/tap in its own frame.

_Sprint_ outlines some guiding principles that we feel are worth reviewing:

> **Work with what you have.**
> Resist inventing new ideas and just work with the good ideas you already came up with.

> **Don’t write together.**
> Your storyboard should include rough headlines and important phrases, but don’t try to perfect your writing as a group. Group copywriting is a recipe for bland, meandering junk, not to mention lots of wasted time. Instead, use the writing from your solution sketches, or just leave it until tomorrow.

> **Include just enough detail.**
> Put enough detail in your storyboard so that nobody has to ask questions like “What happens next?” or “What goes here?” when they are prototyping on Thursday. But don’t get too specific. You don’t need to perfect every frame or figure out every nuance. It’s okay to say: “Whoever builds this tomorrow can decide that detail.” And then move on.

> **When in doubt, take risks.**
> Sometimes you can’t fit everything in. Remember that the sprint is great for testing risky solutions that might have a huge payoff. So you’ll have to reverse the way you would normally prioritize. If a small fix is so good and low-risk that you’re already planning to build it next week, then seeing it in a prototype won’t teach you much. Skip those easy wins in favor of big, bold bets.

> **Keep the story fifteen minutes or less.**
> Make sure the whole prototype can be tested in about fifteen minutes. That might seem short, especially since your customer interviews will be sixty minutes long.

This last point is a friendly reminder that your storyboard should reflect an experience that you'll hope to simulate during user testing.

:::warning
If your chosen solutions represent different stages in a journey, you might be able to create a single story. This, however, is not necessary; if you need to document multiple stories, find opportunities to branch your story to accommodate your solutions that will be tested.

## Summary

- Storyboard is series of drawings or pictures that depict a narrative sequence of events
- Storyboards are alignment and communication tools that can be used internally or with clients
- The opening scene(s) of a storyboard should reflect one or two steps that precede the interactions with the product
- Storyboards should focus on a user flows that best represent the target event and each frame should represent a click event for a digital product
