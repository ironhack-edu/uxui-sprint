## 1. Organize into teams

Following the recommendations of the _Sprint_ book, the class will be divided into even teams of no more than 7 participants.

Once you are split into teams, you will be working in this setup for the rest of the week to complete the exercises.

#### Decider

For this GV Design Sprint, the role of the **decider** will be assumed by the instructor.

## 2. Explore the company and product

Explore the company's website so that you can experience it first-hand and see where the potential pain points and opportunities in the experience are.

- Split your team into users and testers
- Gather insights on the customer's experience - the "users" will act as the customers - the "testers" will observe the user and take notes
  :::

## 3. Create Google Slides Deck

- **Assign** one person on your team to create a slide deck
- **Title** it "GV Sprint Deliverables: Team #"
- **Share** it with the rest of your team and the instructor
- **Make** sure you post all of your "expected deliverables" in the deck throughout the week

## 4. List sprint questions

Review the following long-term goal as a team.

**Long-term goal**: "A shopping experience that is as fresh and fun as the flower-boxes."
:::
Get pessimistic. Ask: What can go wrong? How might we fail? Turn these fears into sprint questions you could answer this week.

**List your sprint questions on a whiteboard.**

## 5. Make a map

> Example

1. List customers and key players on the left.
2. Draw the ending, with your completed goal, on the right.
3. Finally, make a flowchart in between showing how customers interact with the product. Keep it simple: five to fifteen steps.

**Draw this on your whiteboard.**
