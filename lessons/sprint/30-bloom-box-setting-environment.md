Divide the whiteboard by tester names and tasks/pages.

## Set up and test A/V equipment

We recommend using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), which will allow you to see the tester's face and the prototype at the same time.

:::warning
Test everything beforehand and don't forget to mute the microphones in the observation room. Make sure the audio quality is good. If the audio quality through the video conferencing software is poor, mute it and use a cellular call.
