<!-- # Case Study - Blue Bottle: Decide and Storyboard -->

## Learning Goals

- Understand how the Blue Bottle team used dot-voting to drive their discussion about the sketches from the previous day
- Learn why James, the Blue Bottle decider, chose to move three main ideas to the prototyping stage
- Understand why and how the Blue Bottle team created a storyboard in advance of their prototyping session

## Deciding

The Blue Bottle team wanted to pull the best ideas from the sketches. In order to decide ideas would move forward, they conducted a round of silent dot-voting.

### Art museum

Posting up their sketched storyboards in a line on the wall, the team walked around with voting dots, placing dots near parts of sketches that they found compelling or interesting.

After voting ended, the team discussed any feature by which a dot-cluster formed. Any standout ideas were noted on a new sticky note and posted on the wall above the sketch.

After the discussion, James, the decider, selected three ideas to move forward with based on the discussion and standout notes.

### Let's get ready to rumble!

In this case, James wanted Friday's session to be focused on a gathering data on three different approaches to the online shopping. Rather than focusing on one prototype, three prototypes of three different ideas would "rumble" during the user testing sessions.

1. Focusing on a story
1. Upfront eCommerce-site
1. Replicating the in-store experience

## Storyboard

Before jumping into prototyping, the team knew they needed to consider where and how their solutions would fit into the user journey. Different from the map they created on day 1, they wanted a more detailed story.

Because they were moving forward with three ideas, they drew three separate stories on one storyboard (whiteboard). They made sure that every click necessary to shop and purchase beans was represented somewhere in the storyboard.

With this storyboard in hand, the team was prepared to prototype the next day.

## Summary

- The Blue Bottle team used dot-voting to focus discussions on good ideas.
- James, the decider, ultimately decided to move forward with three different approaches to shopping for coffee. These three approaches would "rumble" during user testing.
- Prior to prototyping, the team laid out the stories for each solution in the form of a storyboard.
