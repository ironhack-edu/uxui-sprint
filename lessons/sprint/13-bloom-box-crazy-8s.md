<!-- # Exercise - Bloom Box: Crazy 8s -->

## Agenda

- Gather materials and fold the crazy 8 paper
- Assign a timer
- Draw

## Expected Deliverable

- 1 crazy eight page (or however many you'd like to run) with 8 boxes filled

## Why do something so crazy?

The reason this exercise is called Crazy 8s is because, in fact, it feels a bit crazy to try to generate so many ideas so quickly. Forcing yourself to come up with eight different ideas in a short amount of time encourages **divergence**.

A common misstep is fleshing out an idea too early without iterating it. This structure makes it easier to generate a variety of ideas _before_ delving into the details. So, don't get hung up on finding a completely new idea. After you've drawn one idea, ask yourself, "What would be another good way to do this?" After you've exhausted your options, then it's time to move on to a new idea.

## Running the Crazy 8

1. Take your A4 sheet of paper and fold it as shown below:

2. Assign someone to set a 60-second timer.
3. When the timer starts, everyone sketches a solution in one box.
4. When the timer ends, everyone stops sketching
5. Restart the timer and continue sketching in the rest of the boxes. At the end of 8 minutes, each box should be filled with a solution.

:::warning
**What do I fill in each box?** Now is not the time to worry about the details. Try to pinpoint one idea from your mind-map and quickly sketch what that looks like. Since our product is a website, consider applicable solutions. This might be a home screen or a prompt. Don't worry about getting every word or button down. Focus on the key features or vocabulary of the page. See examples or what some sketches might look like.

:::danger
:warning: 99% of the time, the one thing stopping someone from succeeding at this activity is hesitation. Remember, success here isn't having eight good ideas. Success looks like having all eight boxes filled. If you get eight sketches down, there is a high likelihood that a good idea or a start of a good one lies there.
