# Providing Project Feedback

> _Every student should have the chance to understand how they're doing, and get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors like us._

**Doing 1-on-1 code reviews with an instructor and receive feedback is so, so important to a student's progress in Ironhack.**

There will undoubtedly be nuances in how we evaluate final, portfolio projects given the simple fact that every project is different – but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to have an organized & direct way to do it.

## Guiding Principles

**The goal of providing feedback on student projects is to give personal guidance to each student, including meaningful suggestions and input that isn’t immediately obvious.**

- **30 minutes of feedback with an instructor** will hopefully be enough time to go over project code and discuss the instructor’s evaluation of their project (via the simple matrix below)
- **Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt**
- **Each of the categories** in the project evaluation template are also outlined in the project specifications.
- The rubric is based on a **simple 3-point scale**
- **The actual measurement for “meets expectation” is tied to the project prompt, and will be different by project**

## Instructor Process

#### 1. Organize Project Evaluation

**Each instructor should provide feedback for a subset of their students**, so we can split up the workload between instructors. Work with your Program Manager to figure out who's helping which students.

**For each student you are assigned, fill out a project evaluation**.

#### 2. Project Feedback + Evaluation template

- _Creativity:_ Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your solution? Did you deliver something engaging and usable to the end user?

- _Methodology:_ Did you follow Design Thinking guidance and best practices covered in class? Did you go through the proper UCD process? Were the problems/ pain points clearly identified, and were the designs decisions based on your findings?

- _Functionality:_ Did the features and functionality meet the needs of the user and business?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Not submitted_
    **1** | _Needs improvement_
    **2** | _Meets expectations_
    **2** | _Exceeds expectations_

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but **the more important scores are described in the specs above**, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

Make a duplicate of the template and bring it to the conversation you have with the student.

> **Note:** Scores like 1.5 are okay, but there's no sense in getting crazy – a score like 1.78 is too detailed to know how to handle as a student.

#### 3. In-Person Code Review

**Each student should have 30 minutes to review their project evaluation and do a code review with an instructor sometime during the week after a project is completed.**

_Make sure you frame this time to the students_ – this is not troubleshooting time, we’re just reviewing code and talking about actionable feedback for enhancing the project in the future.

- **Student** _(10 mins)_: Have the student walk through and defend their code.

- **Student** _(10 mins)_: Have the student answer the following questions.

  - What do you like most about your app?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?

- **Instructor** _(10 mins)_: Talk through the evaluation, and share a “glow and grow”.

  - Make it personal – what about the app was exciting or intriguing for you as a user?
  - Share highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, project approach
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. **Set 1 or 2 specific goals for the next project.** If you’re reviewing the second or third project with the student, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously!

**Be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your Team, Program Manager, and General Manager.** Everyone should be able to have a good idea of how the whole class is doing if we split it up and share our findings!
